 * CMocka Unit tests now have 53% coverage by lines. In important functions this is near 100% - models is 93%, anneal is 90%, chisq 72% etc.
 * Uprooted and completely rewrote relaxation fitting models (eg models/). Instead of having ~5 separate R1 and R2 generators, there is now a single one.
 * Calculation of GAF order parameters is now done once per iteration, instead of once per relaxation measurement. This gives a massive speed improvement.
 * GAF_S2 code optimized, with simple squaring predone. ~30% speed improvement.
 * Combination of these has given ~240x speed increase on old models. Unit testing used to verify model against previous implementation and all pass.

 * Added simulated annealing as an optimization method.
 * Nelder-Mead method is good at optimizing within a minima, but it appears the system here has a LOT of local minima.
 * So for Nelder-Mead, a large number of random starting points are needed and even then I'm not sure it necessarily finds the true global minima.
 * Simulated annealing, at least as done here, is worse at finding true minima of minima, but is much better at finding global minima.
 * So by running searches for global minima with simulated annealing, and then using simplex to find true minima seems to work better.

 * Added unit tests.
 * CMocka based unit tests to check the majority of functions.

 * Removed pthread parallelisation and replaced with MPI/OpenMP parallelisation.
   * Can give ~2x speed up depending on model.
 * Tested running on Tinis HPC cluster successfully.

2021-02-01
 * Added global GAF fitting. 
 * Can be enabled by passing GLOBAL = 1 parameter in system file.
 
2021-01-25
 * Added C/N ratio support.
   * Changes relative weighting of 13C and 15N data in chisq function to account for differences in amount of data.

2021-01-04
 * Added plotting support for *AIMF* models.

2020-12-20
 * Added anisotropic model free model. Models order parameter as a 3D tensor.
 
2020-12-03
 * Data visualisation redone; gnuplot scripts replaced by python scripts.
 * README updated.
