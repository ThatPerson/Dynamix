 * Added simulated annealing as an optimization method.
 * Nelder-Mead method is good at optimizing within a minima, but it appears the system here has a LOT of local minima.
 * So for Nelder-Mead, a large number of random starting points are needed and even then I'm not sure it necessarily finds the true global minima.
 * Simulated annealing, at least as done here, is worse at finding true minima of minima, but is much better at finding global minima.
 * So by running searches for global minima with simulated annealing, and then using simplex to find true minima seems to work better.

 * Removed pthread parallelisation and replaced with MPI/OpenMP parallelisation.
   * Can give ~2x speed up depending on model.
 * Tested running on Tinis HPC cluster successfully.

2021-02-01
 * Added global GAF fitting. 
 * Can be enabled by passing GLOBAL = 1 parameter in system file.

 * Added C/N ratio support.
   * Changes relative weighting of 13C and 15N data in chisq function to account for differences in amount of data.

2021-01-04
 * Added plotting support for *AIMF* models.

 * Added anisotropic model free model. Models order parameter as a 3D tensor.

 * Data visualisation redone; gnuplot scripts replaced by python scripts.
 * README updated.
